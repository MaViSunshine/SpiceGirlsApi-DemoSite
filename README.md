# SpiceGirlsApi-DemoSite
Site to fetch the Spice Girls API I made, as demo.
------
Made to look 90's as requested by tech twitter, that it's by some reason very invested in the Spice Girls having an API.
-------
Is not fully finished, since I want to test out adding things to the actual API (like individual photos, maybe a page for concerts and such if i find that data) and make it fully responsive once that is added.
